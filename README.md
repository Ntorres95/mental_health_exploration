# mental_health_exploration
An exploratory project on mental health and suicide rates around the world.

# Goal
The aim of this project is to explore the data on suicide rates and and mental health resource availability around the world. In doing so I hope to further educate myself on the reality of this topic and paint a fuller picture both for myself.

# Inspiration
As someone who suffers from a mental illness, this has always been a topic at the forefront of my life. As I mentioned earlier, I'd like to more throroughly educate myself on the topic as to be better prepared. I thought that approaching it from this angle might give me a slighty more detailed perspective on the matter. While this approach seperates me from the individual experiences and its complexity, I believe it helps to shed a brighter light on the gravity of the matter.
